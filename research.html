            We realized we needed to take a breath and consider: <b>Are we designing the thing right when we really should be designing the right thing?</b> Instead of pushing ahead with our plan to test our assumptions with Boulder Crest students through the parallel prototypes we developed, we needed to first consider if myPATHH needed to serve other purposes beyond its current state. We also needed to better understand the context in which we are designing—so we set off to Boulder Crest.

                <div>
                        Our goals for this trip were:
                        To more deeply understand the context in which we are designing, learn from the staff.
                       To build rapport with and get feedback from our client.
                       To bond as a team. 
                       
                       Not only did we achieve our goals, we got an added bonus of tranquility. Even though we were working nonstop, we felt this immense sense of peace on the grounds of Boulder Crest.
                       
                       After we arrived at Boulder Crest early Friday afternoon, we jumped right in and conducted five back-to-back interviews with Boulder Crest staff. Almost all of the staff whom we interviewed had previously gone through the program themselves, so it was valuable to hear about their own experiences as both participants and staff.
                       
                       We made a conscious decision with our client not to conduct user research with current program participants because we did not want to intrude on their precious time at the retreat.
                       
                       We left Boulder Crest with a wealth of data and are excited to synthesize it as a team.
                       
                       We also had the opportunity to immerse ourselves in various retreat activities. We experienced a surreal bonding moment during a particular retreat tradition: Walking the labyrinth. Labyrinths have been used for thousands of years, and their twisting, indirect paths force a slow, meditative journey. At the start of the labyrinth, each of us picked out a stone to carry while walking the path. We walked slowly. We reflected inward. We all paused in the middle, closed our eyes for a moment, and laid our rocks down. 
                       
                       Later, we realized how many heroes had held those same rocks in their hands as they, too, had walked the labyrinth.

                    These speed dating sessions were valuable. Rather than simply refuting or confirming these assumptions, the reaction was always a bit more complicated. What we got was a more nuanced understanding, which will guide our design process moving forward.

                During our interviews and calls with Boulder Crest students and staff, we’ve been struck time and time again the powerful journeys of these inspirational individuals. Telling one’s story is a core tenet of Boulder Crest’s path toward Post-Traumatic growth, and our Users skill in this area has led to truly insightful conversations. As we’ve progressively come to learn what makes Boulder Crest so valuable and unique, we’ve also come to appreciate the limits of our understanding. We will never be able to fully know what it feels like to live with trauma, to feel lost in hardship, and to repurpose that struggle into a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Learning first-hand from users is a core principle of experience design, but working with Boulder Crest students has made this especially apparent.

                Over the course of this eight-month project, our team will have the opportunity to help Boulder Crest better serve the veteran community. We feel truly lucky to be working in such an important and impactful problem space, and excited to explore, evaluate, and improve their tools and program offerings.
