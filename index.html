                How do you restructure suffering into strength? How can a person experience unforgettable pain then return to a normal, peaceful life?  When carrying the weight of past trauma, is it possible to find new meaning and fulfillment?

        Boulder Crest offers retreats for veterans, active duty service members, first responders, and their families. Many of these individuals have been through combat, and many have experienced Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) or depression. </p>

<p>
        Boulder Crest’s cornerstone program is Warrior PATHH. Over 18 months, a team of six students, called a Fire Team, participate in a regimented seven-day retreat led by PATHH guides, who are often alumni of the program. Once students return home from the retreat, they participate in an aftercare program where they integrate the lessons they learned from the retreat via a responsive web app, called myPATHH, and regular video calls with their Fire Team. <b>We as a capstone team were tasked with “studying the use of myPATHH to identify, prototype and validate opportunities to improve existing functionality as well as add new capabilities,” according to our project brief.</b></p>
