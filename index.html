            These are the challenges central to the mission Boulder Crest, our client and an organization dedicated to the physical and emotional well-being of Americaâ€™s veterans, active duty service members, first responders, and their families. Boulder Crest champions the concept of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), a concept whereby trauma and hardship can be reframed as a means of strength and resilience.

            Boulder Crest offers a variety of programs, including Warrior PATHH, an 18-month program involving a regimented 7-day retreat at one of their locations followed by an aftercare program utilizing an app that they developed, called myPATHH, to reinforce and integrate lessons learned at the retreat into their daily lives. Through various research and design activities this semester, we learned that it is hard for Boulder Crest students to stay connected to their team and lessons over the 18-month follow-up. We are making it our mission during the summer semester to improve connection through an app redesign and service design touchpoints.
